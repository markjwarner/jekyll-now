I'm a PhD canditate at the Institute of Digital Health within UCL’s Interaction Centre (UCLIC). I use mixed methods, drawing on theory from the fields of psychology, economics, sociology, and evolutionary biology, to understand people's online social behaviours. I am especially interested in how people manage privacy around sensitive information in online social spaces.

My current research which has been published at CSCW and CHI is interested in how men who have sex with men (MSM) manage HIV status information in online sex-social apps (dating apps). I've utilised secondary sources of public domain data to understand user attitudes to HIV status disclosure fields being introduced into these environments. Having conducted extensive interviews with users, I have developed behavioural insights into why users choose to disclose their status through these HIV status disclosure fields, and how these fields are affecting user interactions. My work challenges the notion of control in the design of sensitive disclosure fields and suggests that privacy may unravel around non-disclosures, as those not disclosing may be assumed to be "hiding" undesirable information.

My research is funded by <a href="https://privacyus.eu">Privacy&Us</a>, EU Marie Skłodowska-Curie Innovative Training Networks.

### More Information

I studied part-time for a masters degree in Security Management at the University of Portsmouth where I was awarded a distinction. My research was focused on how privacy concerns are formed, and how these concerns impact levels of self-censorship when communicating over online social messaging platforms.

Prior to joining UCLIC, I worked as an advisor in digital forensics for a criminal investigations department in the Middle East. I was responsible for developing enhanced capabilities for extracting, analysing, and processing data from electronic devices in criminal investigations.

I like cats, and being a husband and dad.
