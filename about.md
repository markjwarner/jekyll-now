Hey, I’m Mark Warner, I’m a PhD researcher at the Institute of Digital Health, within UCL’s Interaction Centre.

I' interested in understanding what motivates people to share their health data in online social networks, and how people manage their health privacy. My research is situated within the context of HIV where I am exploring the disclosure decision-making behaviours of gay and bisexual men in online sex-social apps like Grindr. 

My research is funded by <a href="https://privacyus.eu">Privacy&Us</a>, EU Marie Skłodowska-Curie Innovative Training Networks.

### More Information

I’m also interested in technology, social psychology, fitness and travel. I worked for 5 years in Abu Dhabi, UAE as an Overseas Foreign Advisor to their Ministry of Interior (MOI). I have travelled to lot's of places in the world, and will travel to many more.
