I am Lecturer in computer and information sciences at Northumbria University in Newcastle, and also have an interest in the fields of psychology and sociology. I draw from these disciplines in my research which is centred around understanding and improving various online social interactions and computer and AI-mediated communication behaviours. I'm particularly interested in how communication technologies impact on wellbeing and how these same technologies could be designed to improve wellbeing (e.g. supporting kinder and more supportive online interpersonal communications and community engagements).

Prior to academia, I worked as an advisor in digital forensics for a criminal investigations department in the Middle East. I was responsible for developing enhanced capabilities for extracting, analysing, and processing data from electronic devices in criminal investigations. Prior to this, I was working for various law enforcement agencies within the UK, focused on developing advanced mobile forensics data recovery techniques. 

During my PhD at the Institute of Digital Health within UCL’s Interaction Centre (UCLIC), I used mixed methods, drawing on theory from the fields of psychology, economics, sociology, and evolutionary biology, to understand people's online social behaviours. I was especially interested in how people manage privacy around sensitive information in online social spaces.

My PhD research which was published at leading HCI conferences (CSCW, CHI) was interested in how men who have sex with men (MSM) manage HIV status information in online sex-social apps (dating apps). I've utilised secondary sources of public domain data to understand user attitudes to HIV status disclosure fields being introduced into these environments. Having conducted extensive interviews with users, I have developed behavioural insights into why users choose to disclose their status through these HIV status disclosure fields, and how these fields are affecting user interactions. My work challenges the notion of control in the design of sensitive disclosure fields and suggests that privacy may unravel around non-disclosures, as those not disclosing may be assumed to be "hiding" undesirable information.

### More Information

I studied part-time for a masters degree in Security Management at the University of Portsmouth where I was awarded a distinction. My research was focused on how privacy concerns are formed, and how these concerns impact levels of self-censorship when communicating over online social messaging platforms.
